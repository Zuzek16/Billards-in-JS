        <p>The starting positions of the balls maybe off from the original rules. I let the engine do it's work</p>
        <h3>How to play</h3>
        <p>The triangle holding the balls in place will disapear after a few moments and allow to start.
            Drag and let go of the cue (white) ball to move it. Your goal is to sink all the colored balls before the black one (8-ball).
            The half colored billards are represented by the colored balls with a white border around them. Don't count it for hitbox.
            If the initial position is off you can hit f5.
