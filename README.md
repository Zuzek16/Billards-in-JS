# Billards-in-JS
A billards game of eight-ball in JS using matter.js for physics

## Disclaimer!
The matter.js file is not made my me! I downloaded it from the matter-js repo (https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/wiki/Getting-started) I included it to make it easier to run my project for other people!
I used AI in order to do mundane things like transforming colors all at once or putting them into an array
